# Advanced Programming Assignments - Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains the solution codes for the assignments of the **Advanced Programming** course. The solutions are implemented in **C#** and are structured in a way that students can easily find and review them after completing their assignments.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to an assignment. Inside each folder, you will find:
- **Solution Files (`.cs`)**: These files contain the correct implementation for each problem in the assignment.
- **Documentation (`HW*`)**: Additional explanations or notes related to the assignment.

### Folder & File Structure:
```
/ (Root)
â”‚â”€â”€ 1/  (Assignment 1)
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 1.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 2.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 3.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 4.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 5.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ HW1 (Documentation)
â”‚â”€â”€ 2/  (Assignment 2)
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 1.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 2.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 3.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 4.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 5.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ HW2 (Documentation)
â”‚â”€â”€ 3/
â”‚â”€â”€ 4/
â”‚â”€â”€ 5/
â”‚â”€â”€ 6/
â”‚â”€â”€ 7/
```

## How to Use
1. **Navigate to the Assignment Folder**: Find the relevant assignment folder (e.g., `1/` for Assignment 1).
2. **Open the Solution Files**: Each problem solution is numbered accordingly (`1.cs`, `2.cs`, etc.).
3. **Review Documentation**: The `HW*` file provides additional details about the assignment.
4. **Learn from the Solutions**: Compare with your own implementation and understand the correct approach.

## Notes
- These solutions are provided for **learning purposes only**. Students are encouraged to attempt the assignments before reviewing the solutions.
- If you have any questions, feel free to discuss them in the course forums or with the Teaching Assistants.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
